### MAJOR UPDATE

- **Blood Layer** - all blood splats other than token splats are drawn on the blood layer.

- **Brush Tool** - blood can now be drawn directly into the scene.
- **Blood Layer Tools**:
  - Toggle - toggles layer visiblity (token splats will still be visible).
  - Select - select and manipulate blood splats on the blood layer. 
  - Brush - draw blood splats directly to the blood layer.
  - Brush Settings - set brush color, font, size, density etc.
  - Wipe - wipes blood layer (token splats will remain).
- Color has been simplified, rbga -> hex colors, alpha is set on the parent container instead.
- New system compatibility system. Adding new systems possible through editing `src/data/systems.ts`
- Many new systems supported: archmage, cyberpunkred, D35E, dark-heresy, dcc, dnd5e, gurps4e, lancer, lotfp, pf1, pf2e, shadowrun5e, starwarsffg, swade, twodsix, uesrpg-d100, wfrp4e
- **Universal System Support** - if a system is not supported it is possible to set a trackable health attribute on each actor type (character, npc etc.) Note: this attribute requires both `.value` and `.max` fields to work.
